For this robot I used ESP32 controller, the rison behinde it is explained in the [wiki](https://github.com/mikic202/RobotCar/wiki) in this repository. I also used simple dc motors, motor controlle, servo and distance sensor. All components are described in detail in wiki.

Algorithms for the robot are created using C++ language and spwcial libraries for microcontrolers. To assemble the code for the robot I used PlatformIO extension for Visual Studio Code
